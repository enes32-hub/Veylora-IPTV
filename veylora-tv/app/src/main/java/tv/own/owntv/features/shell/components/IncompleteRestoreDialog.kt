/**
 * Shown at launch when a backup restore was interrupted (B2). A restore spans the database and
 * several preference files, so an unlucky kill can leave it half-applied — a merge, so nothing was
 * deleted, but some sections may simply not be there. Rather than let that pass unnoticed, the app
 * says so and points at the fix: run the same restore again (it's idempotent — a re-run merges the
 * missing parts back in).
 *
 * [description] is the backup file name plus the sections that were being applied; never a secret.
