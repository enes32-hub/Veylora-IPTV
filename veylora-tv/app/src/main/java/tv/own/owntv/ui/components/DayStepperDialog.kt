/**
 * A day count, chosen with left and right.
 *
 * One focusable value that steps by a day; the remote's own key repeat handles holding. The range
 * clamps rather than wraps, so a held key settles on an end instead of jumping from the top back to
 * the bottom.
 *
 * Shared, because three settings ask the same question in different words — the playlist refresh
 * interval, the EPG refresh interval, and how many days of guide to keep — and they were about to be
 * three copies of the same stepper.
